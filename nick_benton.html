<p></b>I am a researcher at <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/" target="_top">Microsoft
Research</a> in Cambridge, working in the Programming Principles and Tools group.</p>

<p>I have been in Cambridge since 1984, when I came up to read Mathematics at <a
HREF="http://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/" target="_top">Pembroke College</a>. I then took the
postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science and stayed in the Computer Laboratory to do my
PhD. This was followed by an SERC Research Fellowship and then by a Research Associateship
on the ESPRIT Basic Research Action LOMAPS. I have been a Bye-Fellow of <a
HREF="http://www.quns.cam.ac.uk/" target="_top">Queens' College</a> since 1995.</p>

<p>From July 1996 to August 1998, I was the Senior Research Scientist at the Cambridge
R&amp;D Lab of Persimmon IT Inc (a small, exciting, and now bankrupt) dotcom.
I joined Microsoft Research (which is large, exciting and not bankrupt) in September
1998.</p>
