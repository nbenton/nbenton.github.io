<h3The Basic Idea</h3>

<p>
In Polyphonic C#, methods can be defined as either
<em>synchronous</em> or <em>asynchronous</em>.  When a synchronous
method is called, the caller is blocked until the method returns, as
is normal in C#. However, when an asynchronous method is called, there
is no result and the caller proceeds immediately without being
blocked.  Thus from the caller's point of view, an asynchronous method
is like a <code>void</code> one, but with the useful extra guarantee
of returning immediately. We often refer to asynchronous methods as
<em>messages</em>, as they are a one-way communication from caller to
receiver (think of posting a letter rather as opposed to asking a
question during a face-to-face conversation).
</p>

<p>By themselves, asynchronous method declarations are not
particularly novel. Indeed, .NET already has a widely-used set of
library classes which allow any method to be invoked asynchronously
(though note that in this standard pattern it is the caller who
decides to invoke a method asynchronously, whereas in Polyphonic C# it
is the callee (defining) side which declares a particular method to be
asynchronous). The significant innovation in Polyphonic C# is the way
in which method bodies are defined.
</p>

<p>
In most languages, including C#, methods in the signature 
of a class are in bijective correspondence with the code of their 
implementations - for each method which is declared, there is a single, distinct 
definition of what happens when that method is called. In Polyphonic C#, 
however, a body may be associated with a <em>set</em> of 
(synchronous and/or asynchronous) methods. We call such a definition a
<em>chord</em>, and a particular method may appear in the 
header of several chords. The body of a chord can only execute once
<em>all</em> the methods in its header have been called. 
Thus, when a polyphonic method is called there may be zero, one, or more chords 
which are enabled:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If no chord is enabled then the method invocation is queued
  up. If the method is asynchronous, then this simply involves adding
  the arguments (the contents of the message) to a queue. If the
  method is synchronous, then the calling thread is blocked.
  </li>

  <li>If there is a single enabled chord, then the arguments of the
  calls involved in the match are de-queued, any blocked thread
  involved in the match is awakened, and the body runs.
  </li>

  <li>When a chord which involves only asynchronous methods 
  runs, then it does so in a new thread.
  </li>
  
  <li>If there are several chords which are enabled
  then an unspecified one of them is chosen to run.
  </li>
  
  <li>Similarly, if there are multiple calls to a
  particular method queued up, we do not specify which call will be
  de-queued when there is a match.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Example: A Simple Buffer</h3>

<p>Here is the simplest interesting example of a Polyphonic 
C# class:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
public class Buffer {
   public String get() & public async put(String s) {
      return s; 
   } 
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
This class declares two methods: a synchronous one, <code>get()</code>, which takes
no arguments and returns a string, and an asynchronous one, <code>put()</code>,
which takes a string argument and (like all asynchronous methods)
returns no result. These two methods appear (separated by an
ampersand) in the header of a single chord, the body of which consists
of the return statement.
</p>

<p>
Now assume that <code>b</code> is an instance of Buffer and that
producer and consumer threads wish to communicate via
<code>b</code>. Producers make calls to <code>put()</code>, which,
since the method is asynchronous, do not block. Consumers make calls
to <code>get()</code>, which, since the method is synchronous, will
block until or unless there is a matching call to
<code>put()</code>. Once <code>b</code> has received both a
<code>put()</code> and a <code>get()</code>, the body runs and the
argument to the <code>put()</code> is returned as the result of the
call to <code>get()</code>. Multiple calls to <code>get()</code> may
be pending before a <code>put()</code> is received to reawaken one of
them and multiple calls to <code>put()</code> may be made before their
arguments are consumed by subsequent <code>get()</code>s.  Note
that
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The body of the chord runs in the 
  (reawakened) thread corresponding to the matched call to get(). Hence no new 
  threads are spawned in this example.
  </li>
  <li>The code which is generated by the class 
  definition above is completely thread safe. The compiler&nbsp; automatically 
  generates the locking necessary to ensure that, for example, the argument to a 
  particular call of put() cannot be delivered to two distinct calls to get(). 
  Furthermore (though it makes little difference in this small example), the 
  locking is fine-grained and brief - polyphonic methods do <em>not</em> lock the 
  whole object and are <em>not</em> executed with &quot;monitor semantics&quot;.
  </li>
  <li>The reader may wonder how we know which 
  of the methods involved in a chord gets the returned value. The answer is that 
  it is always the synchronous one, and there can be at most one synchronous 
  method involved in a chord.
  </li>
</ol>
