I work on the semantics, design and implementation of programming
languages. One goal is to develop new languages, programming models,
abstractions and reasoning principles that enable programmers write
correct, reliable, secure software more easily and quickly. A second
is to develop compiler and implementation technologies that allow
programs to execute and interoperate more efficiently. I'm a firm believer in the not entirely unreasonable
effectiveness of mathematics in computing science.
<!-- But as well -->
<!-- being practically useful, the theory of programming languages is -->
<!-- beautiful, deep, challenging and fun, which is the real reason for -->
<!-- doing it.   -->

<p>My PhD thesis was on strictness analysis, a compile-time
program analysis for lazy functional languages such as Haskell. One of
its applications is in selectively transforming call-by-need
evaluation (which gives the language nice equational properties but is
not terribly efficient) into call-by-value (which is generally less
costly). I developed a logical, or type theoretic, technique for
strictness analysis, and investigated its denotational semantics and
extension with polymorphism and algebraic datatypes.

One of the prettiest things there is in life is a three-way
correspondence between an intuitionistic logic, a type theory and a
class of categorical model. Between 92 and 98, working at various
times with Gavin Bierman, Valeria de Paiva, Martin Hyland and Philip
Wadler, I did lots of this `categorical proof theory', with particular
reference to linear logic. We came up with term calculi and
categorical models for various forms of intuitionistic linear logic,
and developed some elegant connections with computational monads. I'm
still especially proud of my strong normalization proof for the linear
term calculus via the encoding of coinductive types in System F.

Like all right-thinking people, I'm a functional programmer. Back in
97, Andrew Kennedy, George Russell and I designed and implemented MLj,
a compiler for Standard ML that compiles to Java bytecodes (<EM>"*wow* This is seriously great!"</EM> - James Gosling). MLj lets
you program in your favourite functional programming language whilst
also having smooth access to a wide range of libraries and components
written in Java (though of course, object orientation is still the work of Beelzebub). You can easily write ML programs that have GUIs, play
music, process XML, run in a web browser or on a web server, and all
the other things that small groups of academics whose primary interest
is compilers tended not to get around to making straightforward. The
MLj compiler has some interesting features too, including being, as far as we know, 
the first implementation of parametric polymorphism by
representation-based specialization (later used to implement generics in the CLR), and the use of a
monadically-typed intermediate language for optimization. Andrew and
I, with Claudio Russo, subsequently developed MLj further into
SML.NET, which targets the .NET Common Language Runtime. We first
showed SML.NET off at PDC 2000, where .NET was officially launched. SML.NET
supports the full SML'97 language standard, including the module
system, and even runs inside Visual Studio.

Luca Cardelli, Cedric Fournet and I designed and implemented
Polyphonic C#, an extension of C# with new constructs for concurrent
programming, derived from the Join Calculus. Writing correct
concurrent programs is notoriously difficult, but Polyphonic C# is
significantly easier to use than traditional lock-based approaches to
concurrency. Furthermore, its simple model applies equally well to
old-fashioned shared memory concurrency on a single machine and to
message-based concurrency across a wide area network. The Polyphonic
C# extensions were later included in C&#969, which also adds XML and
relational data manipulation features to C#.

Quite a bit of my work has involved modelling and reasoning about mutable
state, in both high and low-level languages. Starting with my
        introduction of Relational Hoare Logic in 2004, I've looked at how
to verify a range of static analyses and the transformations they
enable, how to reason about program equivalences in the presence of
higher-order functions and dynamically allocated references, and how
to design compositional program logics for low-level languages such as
assembly code. Much of this work was formalized using the Coq
proof assistant, which is both an amazingly great system and a fine
way to keep one's productivity down to a respectable level. I'm a proud member of the <a href="http://www.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/parametric/">parametricity mafia</a>.
</p>

<p>
When I joined Facebook, I soon got to put some of this research into
practice by building an automated tool for showing semantic equivalence
of the bytecode produced by old and new versions of the Hack
compiler. My team is currently overhauling the Hack type system and
inference algorithm.
