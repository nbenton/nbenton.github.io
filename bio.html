Nick Benton has an M.A. in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Computer Science
from the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>. He was a SERC Research Fellow and
then a Research Associate, both in the University of Cambridge
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Computer Laboratory</a>, before becoming Senior Research Scientist at
<a href="http://www.persimmon.com/">Persimmon IT, Inc</a> in 1996. He joined Microsoft Research in 1998.
<p>
His research interests include functional programming, typed lambda
calculi, linear logic, static analysis and optimising compilers. His
Ph.D. thesis concerned logical systems for performing strictness
analysis of lazy functional programs and he subsequently worked on the
proof theory, term calculi and categorical models of intuitionistic
logics, particularly linear logic. At Persimmon IT, he led a group
which, amongst other things, developed a <a
href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/~mlj/">compiler</a> from Standard ML to
Java bytecodes.
